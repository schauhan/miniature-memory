I'm a product leader based in **Austin, TX**. Besides product I work on growth strategy, marketing, and data analytics, the last one being my favorite.

### :octopus: product development

I build cloud-native and data-heavy software products for startups, enterprise, IoT and FinTech orgs. To me, product management is a combination of problem-solving and asking the right questions. I work with engineering, design, marketing, and business to create a product strategy and build products which make someones' life easier.

### :snail: experience

I've been in tech for over 12 years during which I've written code, worked with engineers and CXOs, performed data analysis, and coached scrum teams. Five years back I moved from software dev to product.

### ...and entreneurship :baby_chick:

Last year I launched a no-code indicator-based algo trading platform, [Algoniti](https://www.algoniti.com/) for the Indian FinTech market.
