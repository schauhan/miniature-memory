**I'm a product leader and strategist in Austin, TX.**

I build cloud-native and data-heavy software products for startups, enterprise, IoT and FinTech orgs. To me, product management is a combination of problem-solving and asking the right questions. I work with engineering, design, marketing, and business to create a product strategy and build products which make someones' life easier.

I've been in tech for over 12 years during which I've written code, worked with engineers and CXOs, performed data analysis, and coached scrum teams. Five years back I moved from software dev to product.

Last year I launched a no-code indicator-based algo trading platform, [Algoniti](https://www.algoniti.com/) for the Indian FinTech market.
