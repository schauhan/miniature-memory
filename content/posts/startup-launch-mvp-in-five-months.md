## :scroll: Background and Motivation

***

[Algoniti](https://www.algoniti.com) is a fintech company I built in 2019-2020 for the Indian stock markets. Our flagship product by the same name is an algo-trading platform for stock traders.

> The platform lets users build and execute trading strategies live in the markets. Once you create your strategy Algoniti places buy/sell orders to your broker via an API call, so you don't have to monitor your portfolio constantly.

### Why is this important? _a.k.a. value proposition_

As of now there are very few products in our market space offering algo-trading. The ones that do, require users to know a programming language (Python in most cases). Algoniti simplifies strategy creation - users can create their strategy using a form, no coding knowledge is needed.

## :video_camera: Initial Research

***

I started working on the idea last year while looking at multiple trading products in the Indian finance space. Before working on the idea I wanted to check the market viability and existing competition. I used the following tools:

### Market Research and Competition Analysis

I collected info on the total market size, brokers offering algo-trading as a service, and estimated the number of interested users. The algo-trading market is estimated to grow 20% yearly between 2020 and 2025.

Next I performed competition analysis and found the alternatives lacking in a good tech solution which users could automate effortlessly. This bolstered our hypothesis about lack of a good solution.

### Checking Product viability

I wrote a few articles on algo-trading, and created a Facebook advertisement for early-access signup for our platform. We received 500+ user visits on articles and 280 signups on the advertisement. This showed us that there demand for a solution for algo-trading.

## :hourglass: Product Strategy: Pricing and Marketing Models

***

Competitive analysis had helped me define the product vision, and I chose a **subscription-based SaaS model** based on the long term plans for product growth. This model is considered relatively low-risk by our target customers as they could cancel anytime. We also started offering a **one month trial** which helped drive customers down our sales funnel.

Being a bootstrapped startup we didn't have a lot of money to throw on paid advertising. I decided to focus on **content marketing and SEO**. I also created an **email marketing campaign (HubSpot)** which serves to move customers down our marketing funnel by using our content.

## :ninja: Building a Team

***

### Dev Team

I got my cofounder to lend 2 software developers to work on the project, while I manage the product backlog and the daily project management. I also hired a designer on contract to help with the web and mobile designs, and designed the initial product architecture.

### Marketing Team

I hired an SEO consultant to help with the website ranking, and a content writer to create blogs and maintain the social presence for the company on Quora and other relevant social platforms.

***

### Prioritizing Features

Algoniti sits between the user and their stock broker and send buy/sell orders based on the trading strategy created by the user. So integration with multiple brokers is crucial for our product to scale. For MVP I decided to integrate with a single broker which serves the largest volume of our target users.

Below is an example user flow for the MVP.

### Managing Project Timelines

I lead the project timelines for Marketing and Product development and used Trello for tracking. Here's how the dev board looked like.

## :man-biking: Launching MVP, Tracking Metrics, KPIs..

***

I launched the platform in April, 2020 after 5 months of development. I user **Google Analytics** and **HotJar** to track visits and user experience. Three months since launch we have over 500 unique monthly visitors and over 100 customers.

The objective for the MVP launch was basically customer acquisition. I monitored the following metrics to keep track of the KPIs.

* Website visitors - Weekly and Monthly
* Free Users
* Subscribers
* Conversion Rate

### Building Strategic Partnerships

I collected user feedback which helped uncover a major issue - a lot of my trial customers didn't know much about algo-trading, and how it could help them. To resolve this I partnered with an educational institute which would train our customers on algo-trading. This helped us reduce our training costs, and gained us additional customers.

### Pitching to VCs

I started pitching the product to VC firms after the product launch and received interest from 3 major firms in India. Unfortunately the pandemic situation prevented us to grow at a rate needed to get to the series A round, which I was planning within a year.

## :rocket: Looking Ahead

***

This was a fun experience and I learnt more in a year as an entrepreneur that in 5 years prior working as a product manager. Although I had to step back due to some growth and scaling issues, I'm planning to taking another shot at entrepreneurship sometime in the next few years.
