# A **Product manager is NOT the CEO of the product**

This article is a rant.

> #### A Product Manager is a CEO of their product...

Statements like these 👆🏽 get my goat every time. Sometimes less experienced product managers take these statements at their face value, assuming product-building to be an end-all-be-all process, which impedes their growth. Below I’ve given some counter-views to showcase how different these roles are.

I’ve formed these after working in the tech field for over 15 years, and having played both these roles at different points in my career. (The CEO role coming from building and running my own company).

Besides these roles having different focus areas, running a company is much harder than building a product - the number of moving pieces increases manifold, and the context switching is mind-boggling.

### Outline and Assumptions

I’ve structured the article into three parts:

* A product manager’s role
* A CEO’s role
* How these roles differ

I’m limiting my scope to technology companies - companies building software products or services. The intended audience is product managers with some experience in building products.

If you are a Director/VP of Product this might not be very interesting. (You role already has a high strategy and planning component, and I suspect you already know that PdMs are not CEOs)

## A Product Manager’s Role

> As a product manager you’ll sit between technology, business, sales, and marketing... You’ll collect requirements from customers and business....and build products that delight the customers...

I’m sure you’ve read these definitions multiple times in job postings and emails from recruiters. Let me give you a definition that works for me.

#### 🍁🍁 You find, and solve, problems for your customers 🍁🍁

Two comments on this definition:

* The first bit (_finding the problem_) is important, and is the stuff that comes before {_insert agile buzzwords}._
* Customers and users might sometimes be different. Customer is someone who pays, while user is, well, who uses the product. Whose problems are you solving? the users’ or the customers’?

Besides, here are some other roles you’ll fill as a product manager. I’ve divided them by areas:

* **Communication**: language translator, asker of questions (from business, tech, sales, and others), opinion former
* **Data**: researcher (before building), data analyzer (after building)
* **Planning, Project Management**: add all the buzzwords you heard that recruiter read from his script: roadmap, prioritization, agile, user story mapping.. you get the idea

## A CEO’s Role

#### 💰💰 The primary job of a CEO is to sell. 💰💰

Read this statement again. This, along with the product manager definition above, show the difference in expectations for these roles.

Let me share a story a friend told me sometime back: There was a baker who worked in a highly successful bakery. His cakes were pretty popular, and was paid handsomely by the bakery owner. The baker had this idea to open his own bakery - why should I have to share the profits with the bakery owner when I do all the hard work? So he opened his own bakery near his old workplace. Unfortunately his cakes didn’t sell like the hot commodity they were at his old place. What this baker didn’t realize was that:

> #### 🎂 Baking a cake and selling a cake are two different skills. 🎂

And selling is not that easy.

Here are a few other components of a CEO’s job. This is by no means a comprehensive list, and is constrained by my current understanding. These functions are overlapping at times.

## Job Function: CEO vs Product Manager

Basically, a CEO is more concerned with selling something, while a product manager is focused on solving customer problems.

### Power

As a CEO you have the ultimate authority over people working for you. Unlike a product manager, you can hire/fire people. A product manager role, in contrast, is based in collaboration, relationship building, and a good deal of soft-power.

You decide the direction the company would take, in terms of products, messaging, market positioning, etc.

### ... and responsibility

With all this power, and people (customers, employees, your board) relying on you to make the correct decisions, a CEO has a relatively low margin of error. The proverbial buck starts with you.

A product manager has it relatively easier - if tomorrow a product failed, it won’t make the company go belly-up (unless it’s a startup, in which case the PM is probably also the CEO).

***

So, there you have it. A product manager is not a CEO of the product. Next time somebody tells you otherwise, maybe they are just trying to motivate you to take more job-functions.
